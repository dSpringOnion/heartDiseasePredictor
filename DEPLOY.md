# 🚀 Railway Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy to Railway

### Option 1: One-Click Deploy (Easiest)
1. Fork/upload this repo to GitHub
2. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
3. Click "Deploy from GitHub"
4. Select this repository
5. Railway will auto-detect and deploy! 🎉

### Option 2: Railway CLI
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize project
railway init

# Deploy
railway up
```

### Option 3: Manual Setup
1. Create new project on Railway
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Railway auto-detects Python and uses:
   - `requirements.txt` for dependencies
   - `Procfile` or `railway.json` for start command
   - Port from `$PORT` environment variable

## 🔧 Configuration Files

- `railway.json` - Railway deployment config
- `Procfile` - Process definition for web dyno
- `runtime.txt` - Python version specification
- `.streamlit/config.toml` - Streamlit production settings

## 🌐 After Deployment

1. Railway will provide a URL like: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`
2. Update your portfolio with the live demo link
3. Test all functionality on the live site

## 🛠️ Environment Variables (if needed)

In Railway dashboard, you can set:
- `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` (already handled)
- `PORT` (auto-provided by Railway)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

**Common issues:**
- **Port binding**: Railway sets `$PORT` automatically
- **Dependencies**: Ensure all packages in `requirements.txt`
- **Streamlit config**: Use headless mode for production

**Logs:**
```bash
railway logs
```

## 💡 Alternative Free Platforms

If Railway doesn't work:

1. **Render.com** - Also excellent for Streamlit
2. **Heroku** - Classic choice (requires buildpack)
3. **Vercel** - Great for static sites
4. **Netlify** - Good for frontend-only apps

## 📊 Performance Tips

- Use `@st.cache_data` for data caching
- Minimize model loading with `@st.cache_resource`
- Enable compression in production
- Consider using Railway's persistent storage for large models
